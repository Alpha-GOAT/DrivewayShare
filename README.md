# DrivewayShare
A website to buy, sell, or rent privately owned parking spots, such as driveways.

The average american spends approximately 6 minutes and 45 seconds to find a parking space. About 34 million parking tickets are handed out each year, all of which average about $104, leading to nearly $5 billion dollars in parking tickets across the country annually. How can we make parking more affordable, less time consuming and an overall easier experience for the average vehicle owner? DrivewayShare.

DrivewayShare connects users with vacant parking spots with users seeking parking spaces. Users are able to post vacant spots in addition to their respective price, which is all managed easily in our listing page. Alternatively, users can search for vacant parking spots by location to find a parking spot convenient for them. Once found, users may use our secure messaging system to contact other users directly. Viola! Your brand new and convenient parking space is yours!
